My favorite memory of Rutmi and I is from growing up when we were little girls and having sleepovers all the time. We would CONSTANTLY be planning our future weddings together in hopes of making those dreams come to life one day. And now fast forward over 27 years later, and we're finally going to see Rutmi have her dream wedding and marry her best friend!",

But my favorite was definitely when Rutmi fought me every step of the way while I was helping Akash plan the proposal, from the adventurous blue nail with ring finger accent to her blue Abercrombie backyard BBQ vibe dress.",
