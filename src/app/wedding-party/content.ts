My favorite memory of Rutmi and I is from growing up when we were little girls and having sleepovers all the time. We would CONSTANTLY be planning our future weddings together in hopes of making those dreams come to life one day. And now fast forward over 27 years later, and we're finally going to see Rutmi have her dream wedding and marry her best friend!",

But my favorite was definitely when Rutmi fought me every step of the way while I was helping Akash plan the proposal, from the adventurous blue nail with ring finger accent to her blue Abercrombie backyard BBQ vibe dress.",

She has been there with me through thick and thin, from those early days when we giggled and cried over critically ‚Äútrashy‚Äù romcoms to our teenage years when she taught me how to hide all of our shopping bags from our dads, deal with the unfortunate realities of the teenage Indian unibrow/mustache situation, and navigate finding myself and true friends in the scary world of middle school and highschool.",
			"She's been the driving force behind some of my fondest memories.We used to spend hours together, microwaving quesadillas (our signature dish), creating hilarious music videos, and dreaming big about our futures. Back then, little did we know that one day, Rutmi would be stepping into a new chapter of her life as a beautiful bride.",
			"But what Rutmi truly taught me goes beyond cooking or shopping. She taught me the importance of having that one person who's always there for you, no matter the distance or time apart. Our love has remained constant, our bond unbreakable.",
			"As we have been approaching this day, I can't help but feel excited about the new memories I will create with her and her wonderful new husband. We'll keep indulging in our cheesy traditions, making music videos, and now, we'll dream about our future with our extended family and hopefully mini versions of ourselves.",
